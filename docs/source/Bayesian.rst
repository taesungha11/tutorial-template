Bayesian Method
================

Bayesian methods are a statistical approach based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to update probabilities as new evidence becomes available. These methods are particularly powerful for making probabilistic inferences, updating beliefs, and estimating uncertainty. Let's break down the key concepts of Bayesian methods:

Bayes' Theorem:
----------------

Bayes' theorem is a fundamental principle in Bayesian statistics. It relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is given by:

P(A∣B)= 
P(B)
P(B∣A)⋅P(A)
​

In the context of Bayesian inference, 

P(A∣B) is the posterior probability, 
P(B∣A) is the likelihood, 
P(A) is the prior probability, and 
P(B) is the evidence or marginal likelihood.

Prior Probability:
----------------

The prior probability represents our initial beliefs or knowledge about a parameter before observing any data. It encapsulates information obtained from prior studies, domain knowledge, or subjective opinions.

Likelihood:
----------------

The likelihood represents the probability of observing the data given a specific set of parameters. It quantifies how well the data supports different parameter values.

Posterior Probability:
----------------

The posterior probability is the updated probability of the parameters after incorporating the observed data. It is obtained by combining the prior probability and the likelihood through Bayes' theorem.

Bayesian Inference Process:
----------------

Bayesian inference involves updating prior beliefs using observed data to obtain a posterior distribution. The process can be summarized as follows:
Prior Knowledge: Start with a prior distribution representing your beliefs about the parameters.
Likelihood: Use the likelihood function to assess how probable the observed data is under different parameter values.
Bayes' Theorem: Combine the prior and likelihood to compute the posterior distribution.
Posterior Inference: Make probabilistic inferences based on the posterior distribution.

MCMC in Bayesian Methods:
----------------

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a key computational tool in Bayesian statistics. It is used to sample from complex and high-dimensional posterior distributions, allowing practitioners to approximate the posterior and make probabilistic inferences.

Applications:
----------------

Bayesian methods are applied in various fields, including machine learning, data analysis, econometrics, and scientific research. They are particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes, complex models, and the need for uncertainty quantification.

Software:
----------------

Python libraries like PyMC3, Stan, and emcee provide tools for implementing Bayesian models and conducting MCMC sampling.

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np
  import pymc3 as pm
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Generate synthetic data
  np.random.seed(42)
  data = np.random.normal(loc=5, scale=2, size=100)

  # Bayesian model
  with pm.Model() as model:
    # Prior distribution
    mu = pm.Normal('mu', mu=0, sd=10)

    # Likelihood
    likelihood = pm.Normal('likelihood', mu=mu, sd=2, observed=data)

    # MCMC sampling
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, cores=1)

  # Plotting the results
  pm.traceplot(trace)
plt.show()
