MCMC
====

Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a statistical technique used for numerical approximation of complex integrals, often arising in Bayesian statistics. It's particularly valuable when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain. MCMC methods are employed to simulate a Markov chain that converges to the desired distribution, allowing practitioners to make probabilistic inferences and estimate parameters.

Markov Chain:
-------------

A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables where the probability of transitioning from one state to another depends only on the current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. This property is known as the Markov property.

Monte Carlo:
-------------

Monte Carlo methods involve using random sampling to obtain numerical results. MCMC is a specific type of Monte Carlo method designed for sampling from complex probability distributions.
Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm:

One of the foundational MCMC algorithms is the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. It iteratively generates samples from a target distribution by proposing new states and accepting or rejecting them based on a specific acceptance criterion.

Gibbs Sampling:
-------------

Another widely used MCMC algorithm is Gibbs sampling, which is a special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In Gibbs sampling, each parameter is updated conditional on the current values of the other parameters, simplifying the sampling process.

Bayesian Inference:
-------------

MCMC is often employed in Bayesian statistics, where it allows for the estimation of posterior distributions of model parameters given observed data. Bayesian inference involves updating prior beliefs with observed data to obtain a posterior distribution.

Burn-in Period:
-------------

The Markov chain may not immediately converge to the target distribution. The initial samples, known as the burn-in period, are often discarded to allow the chain to reach equilibrium.

Convergence Diagnostics:
-------------

It's crucial to assess the convergence of the Markov chain to ensure that the samples are representative of the target distribution. Diagnostics such as trace plots and the Gelman-Rubin statistic are commonly used for this purpose.

Applications:
-------------

MCMC is used in various statistical applications, including parameter estimation, model fitting, Bayesian hypothesis testing, and uncertainty quantification.

Software:
-------------

Popular statistical software packages like Stan, JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler), and PyMC provide implementations of MCMC algorithms, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to apply these methods.


Python Code Example:
---------------------

.. code-block:: python

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pymc3 as pm

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
true_slope = 2
true_intercept = 3
noise = np.random.normal(scale=2, size=100)
x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y_true = true_slope * x + true_intercept
y_observed = y_true + noise

# Bayesian linear regression model using PyMC3
with pm.Model() as model:
    # Priors for the parameters
    slope = pm.Normal('slope', mu=0, sd=10)
    intercept = pm.Normal('intercept', mu=0, sd=10)

    # Likelihood
    likelihood = pm.Normal('y', mu=slope*x + intercept, sd=2, observed=y_observed)

    # MCMC sampling
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, cores=1)  # Adjust these values based on your needs

# Plotting the results
pm.traceplot(trace)
plt.show()
