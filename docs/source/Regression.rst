Regression
===========

Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between one or more independent variables (predictors) and a dependent variable (outcome). It aims to model the underlying relationship and make predictions based on observed data. Here's an overview of regression analysis:

Basic Linear Regression:
------------------------

Linear regression is one of the simplest forms of regression. In a simple linear regression, there is one independent variable, and the relationship between the variables is assumed to be linear. The equation for a simple linear regression model is given by:



Multiple Linear Regression:
------------------------

Multiple linear regression extends the concept to include more than one independent variable. The equation becomes:


Bayesian Linear Regression:
------------------------

In Bayesian linear regression, a Bayesian approach is taken to estimate the model parameters. Instead of assuming fixed values for the coefficients, Bayesian regression treats them as random variables with prior distributions.
Bayesian Regression Process:

The Bayesian regression process involves specifying prior distributions for the coefficients, defining a likelihood function based on the observed data, and using Bayes' theorem to update the prior beliefs to obtain a posterior distribution for the coefficients.

P(β∣data)∝P(data∣β)⋅P(β)

The posterior distribution provides a probabilistic description of the likely values of the coefficients given the observed data.

Bayesian Regression Example:
------------------------

.. code-block:: python

  Here's a simple example of Bayesian linear regression using PyMC3 in Python:

  import numpy as np
  import pymc3 as pm
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

  # Generate synthetic data
  np.random.seed(42)
  x = np.random.rand(100)
  true_slope = 2
  true_intercept = 1
  y_observed = true_intercept + true_slope * x + np.random.normal(scale=0.5, size=100)

  # Bayesian linear regression model
  with pm.Model() as model:
    # Priors for the coefficients
    intercept = pm.Normal('intercept', mu=0, sd=10)
    slope = pm.Normal('slope', mu=0, sd=10)

    # Likelihood
    likelihood = pm.Normal('y', mu=intercept + slope*x, sd=0.5, observed=y_observed)

    # MCMC sampling
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, cores=1)

  # Plotting the results
  pm.traceplot(trace)
  plt.show()
